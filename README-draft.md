# Center for Machine Arts Inaugural Residency

From June 11 - June 18 I spent a week at Bantam Tools with 6 other artists at the brand new Center for Machine Arts making art with plotters.

Here I'm going to documument my projects from the week.

## Waves

Going into the week I had the intention to try to programmatically create scene of ocean waves in line drawings. When discussing the idea with Lingdong Huang he referred me to the work of Ma Yuan and his series of water studies [link]. These felt like perfect prompts for some drawing challenges. The difficulty of each scene seemed to track with how tumultuous the water is.
